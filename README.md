# portfolio-generator

## Description
*A simple app created with node.js to generate a portfolio automatically by answering a few prompts.
This takes away the tediousness of going in and updating a portfolio that may have been created using HTML and CSS, restructuring and moving things around, and instead takes all the bare-bones information needed and automatically sorts and styles a neat portfolio for you.*

## Installation
- Clone repo into your local repo
- download all necessary node extensions
- run "node app" in console/terminal

## Usage
User will be prompted to enter information about themselves (name, github username, optional "about me") as well as information about their projects (name, description, built with, github repo link, whether or not user would like to feature the project or not). Styles are built in with CSS style sheet.
